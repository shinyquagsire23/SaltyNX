# SaltyNX

Background process for the Nintendo Switch for file/code modification

Created by: https://github.com/shinyquagsire23

This fork includes many QoL improvements and beside plugins support also supports patches. 

Since 0.7.0 version NX-FPS and ReverseNX-RT is an intergral part of SaltyNX Core. This allows us to run them in 64-bit games not compatible with plugins.

Patches pattern:
- filename is symbol of function with filetype `.asm64`,
- inside file write with hex editor instructions that you want to overwrite for this function,
- put this file either to `SaltySD/patches` to make it work for every game, or to `SaltySD/patches/*titleid*` to make it work for specific game.

For additional functions you need SaltyNX-Tool

Tests were done on FW 7.0.1-16.1.0 with Atmosphere up to 1.5.5

No technical support for:
- Atmosphere forks
- SX OS
- Kosmos
- ReinX

Known issues:
- Instability with some homebrews and sysmodules (like emuiibo),
- You need to have at least Hekate 5.0.2 if you don't want issues related to Hekate,
- 32 bit games are unsupported,
- Cheats using directly heap addresses may not work properly while using plugins.

# How to download release:

For Atmosphere >=0.10.1 just put folders from archive to root of your sdcard.

For Atmosphere <=0.9.4 and any other CFW rename `contents` folder to `titles`

For SX OS remember to rename `atmosphere` folder to `sxos`

Remember to restart Switch

Titles other than 32-bit are added to exceptions.txt which is treated as Black list, you can find it in root of repo. SaltyNX reads it from SaltySD folder. `X` at the beginning of titleid means that this game will not load any patches and plugins. `R` at the beginning of titleid means that this game will not load any patches and plugins if romfs mod for this game is installed.

32-bit games are ignored by default for patches and plugins.
